# Piction-Photo-Editor
Piction Photo Editor is a simple Photo Editor written in Python using OpenCV!

Tools used in Development:

Tkinter
•	Tkinter is a Python binding to the Tk GUI toolkit. It is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit, and is Python's de facto standard GUI 
•	Tkinter is included with the standard Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X installation of Python.
•	Python interpreter has built-in TCL interpreter which handles all the tkinter commands 

PAGE GUI Editor
Link : https://sourceforge.net/projects/page/
•	PAGE GUI Editor provides a very intuitive way to design the GUI for a Python App with Tkinter
•	First the GUI is constructed using drag and drop style interface within the PAGE App. Various customizations like the Colors, position are set here itself
•	Once the GUI is built, its saved in (.tcl) file format
•	The GUI can now be converted into auto generated Python Code by the PAGE App which encloses the GUI code into a Class and does most of the heavy lifting for us!
•	Now the logic of the code needs to be edited to make the Application useful!
 
JetBrains PyCharm IDE

•	PyCharm Community Edition is the IDE used for development of Piction
•	PyCharm provides a comfortable development environment with very useful suggestions while typing and many other features including the most important : Attractive dark Theme!

OpenCV (CV : Computer Vision)

•	OpenCV Python is the Image Processing Framework used to do all the manipulations on the Images in Piction.
•	OpenCV stores the Images in the form of Numpy Array so the Numerical python Module need to be installed in the System
•	OpenCV provided very simple interface to play around with images, most of the manipulations In Images are no brainers like just couple of lines of Code
•	OpenCV is extensively used in fields where Image Processing is required as in Robotics, Machine Learning, Image Analysis, etc.
